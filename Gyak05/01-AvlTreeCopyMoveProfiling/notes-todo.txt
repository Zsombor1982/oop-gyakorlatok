Notes: todo in class

1. make printing of layers more efficient (don't start from root at each iteration)
2. better - adaptive - spacing by taking into account number of digits in next key
3. implement rotate left and fix balancing issues
4. try to print tree with ... 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 - see if it's well balanced
5. check whether copies are deep or shallow...
6. make copies deep by implementing copy constructor
7. note that it matters whether deep copy is initialization or assignment... if assignment,
need to implement copy assignment too, in order for deep copy to work
8. copy assignments use the swap function (first we use copy constructor to make sure memory
allocation doesn't fail... then swap)
9. but swap function will work only if move semantics is also implemented -> implement move constructor
10. problem: swap uses move assignment, not constructor. So need to implement that, otherwise
wrong functions are called and stack overflow occurs
